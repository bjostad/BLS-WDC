# Bureau of Labor Statistics - Unemployment Data
 Tableau Web Data Connector

This is a web data connector for Tableau which will connect Tableau to the BLS Unimployment Data. Due to CORS, this will need to use a proxy, and is currently hardcoded to use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com

In order to use this WDC, seriesIDs will need to be provided (comma seperated). A free API key will also need to be entered.

# Connect to this WDC from Tableau Desktop at https://www.bjo.io
